It was, again, be a three year study. He unblinds it, gives AZT to all the controls, declare that it's so successful that we, that it's unethical to keep it from the controls.\"\n\n\"And then he then he erases the control group. And the he didn't tell anybody that people found out later is that AZT was so hideously toxic. It's like remdesivir. Yeah. The NCI, the National Cancer Institute, when they developed it, they threw it on the junk yard.\"\n\n\"They they developed it as a cancer chemotherapy drug with a and cancer chemotherapy drugs poison every cell in your body and will kill you. It will kill a hundred percent of the people who take them because they take them up for a long period of time. What you hope is you give it to them for two weeks and hope it kills the tumor before it kills the the person. And so but AZT was so toxic. It killed all the mites in the experiment.\"\n\n\"They threw it in the junk yard. Early on, Blacksmith's client found that when they put AZT in a culture with HIV, it killed all the HIV. Not surprising, it killed everything. Right. Oh, Tony Fauci developed it as the only age drug, and he had to do the same thing he did with the vaccines.\"\n\n\"He had to kill all of the repurposed medications, and he had to keep the people who were getting AZT were dying so fast that he began sneaking them transfusions. So a lot of those people were getting blood full blood transfusions every day to keep him alive for the eight week period so he could declare victory.\" \n\n\"Then he got the permission to use the drug or, you know, he walked it through FDA like he does through a fixed FDA panel that's made up of his paid investigators. And then he mandated for everybody, not only who has AIDS, but people who are deemed by a PCR test to have HIV, many of whom would never get sick. And all of the virtually everybody who was on ATT died.\"\n\n\"Most of them died within a year. Almost all of them died within two years. He killed with AZT probably three hundred and thirty thousand people during the nineteen eighties and early nineteen nineties. The other thing he did, Del, which is part of this playbook that you're talking about, is he suppressed all of the drugs. There were local doctors who were treating AIDS patients in New York and San Francisco and Dallas, etcetera, they were finding a lot of drugs that worked for the AIDS symptoms very, very effectively.\"\n\nAerosol pentazine was one of those. It had tremendous efficacy. But the AIDS patients, most of them were impoverished because they couldn't work, were were unable to get it because the insurance companies would not give it to them because it wasn't approved by FDA. They were begging Tony Fauci to get FDA to approve, but he refused. He said, we don't have placebo controlled trials.\"\n\n\"And so that's what the film Dallas Buyers Club is about. It's people,  Matthew McConaughey and a lot of other people with the AIDS who discovered that AZT was killing everybody who was who was taking it, and they were and they were going to Mexico, to Canada, to Europe to get these drugs that actually worked, smuggling them back in The United States and distributing them to AIDS patients.\" \n\n\"And Michelle Wallace, who wrote that film, initially made Tony Fauci the antagonist in her script. He was the villain in the film. In the end, when they made the film, they took him out of it. He was the guy who was killing all these hate patients, denying them a drug that the local doctors had proven work.\" \n\nMy uncle, as I show in the book, Teddy Kennedy, was deeply involved in forcing Tony Fauci finally to approve this off purpose medication as the exact same thing he's done with ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine killing these drugs because they compete with the vaccines that he knows his buddies are gonna make money from.\"The media could not be played.Reload7:29 AM ¬∑ Feb 27, 2025¬∑139.5K Views1212.7K5K1KRead 121 replies",

It's like a seasonal flu. He had to block all those things in order to make way for his vaccines, and that's what he did. And that's why the Chinese had a population death rate. In other words, three people die from COVID per million population. Our population death rate was twenty two hundred per million.

And then Tony Fauci tried it on Zika. He tried it on Ebola. And in December of 2019, remember this was one month before the pandemic urgency is clear, it was in a trial in Africa with four other drugs where they were treating Ebola patients.\" \n\n\"Now Ebola patients, 50% of them died. And the safety monitoring board stepped in and said you got it to pull the remdesivir out of the trial. I think 30% of them died after they took it for five days. They said it's too dangerous to give to Ebola patients or 50% of them are gonna die. A month later, Fauci takes that drug, and he knows it's too dangerous to give to Ebola patients. And he puts it in fake trials for COVID.\"\n\n\"And he approved that drug, emergency use authorization without having a study published, with having no data that showed that it prevented a single death. And he had to go in twice fraudulently, change the study protocols to show that it reduced hospital stays by three days. He could not show that it prevented death.\" \n\n\"The WHO and the Chinese then published studies almost simultaneously saying not only does it not prevent deaths, and these were actually very powerful studies, really good studies with real placebos. They said not only does it not prevent deaths, it does not reduce hospital stays.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, Tony Fauci got this drug approved. And the reason he got it approved is because you can only give remdesivir with intravenous, which means it can only be used on hospital patients, which means it would not compete with vaccines.\"The media could not be played.Reload10:54 PM ¬∑ Feb 28, 2025¬∑35.8K Views39552929236Read 39 replies",

Evidence now indicates that SV40 is causing infections in humans & represents an emerging pathogen. \n\nThe Multi-Hit Of Oncogenesis After Vaccination By Dr Peter McCollough, MD Cardiologist:\n\n\"Messenger RNA vaccines impair DNA repair, it actually tips the scale towards cancer promotion in cells.\"\n\n\"The S2 spike protein is only found in the vaccine, it is not in the infection. The spike protein, the S2 segment, inhibits the P53 & BRCA tumor suppressor system.\"\n\n\"Our natural tumor suppressor systems are impaired & shut down. This predisposes someone to develop all cancer, but particularly BRCA positive breast & reproductive cancers.\"\n\n\"Recent findings show mRNA based vaccines, both Pfizer & Moderna, have DNA process related impurities.\" \n\n\"At least 4 laboratories have documented this, 2 recent papers by David Speicher & Kevin Mckernan have identified elevated DNA fragments in amounts & in size.\"\n\n\"They come from circular pieces of DNA used, that have the code for the messenger RNA. They are in the form of a plasmid in the E. Coli.\" \n\n\"The fragments that are detected are the SV40 enhancer, promoter & origin of insertion, as well as antibiotic resistance fragments that are used in the manufacturing process.\" \n\n\"The reason why SV40 is important, it stands for Simian Virus 40, a known proto-oncogene activator. The covid vaccines have at least 3 mechanisms by which they start a cancer, promote an existing cancer & promote it much more rapidly because tumor defense systems are taken down.
