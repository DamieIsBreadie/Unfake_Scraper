It was, again, be a three year study. He unblinds it, gives AZT to all the controls, declare that it's so successful that we, that it's unethical to keep it from the controls.\"\n\n\"And then he then he erases the control group. And the he didn't tell anybody that people found out later is that AZT was so hideously toxic. It's like remdesivir. Yeah. The NCI, the National Cancer Institute, when they developed it, they threw it on the junk yard.\"\n\n\"They they developed it as a cancer chemotherapy drug with a and cancer chemotherapy drugs poison every cell in your body and will kill you. It will kill a hundred percent of the people who take them because they take them up for a long period of time. What you hope is you give it to them for two weeks and hope it kills the tumor before it kills the the person. And so but AZT was so toxic. It killed all the mites in the experiment.\"\n\n\"They threw it in the junk yard. Early on, Blacksmith's client found that when they put AZT in a culture with HIV, it killed all the HIV. Not surprising, it killed everything. Right. Oh, Tony Fauci developed it as the only age drug, and he had to do the same thing he did with the vaccines.\"\n\n\"He had to kill all of the repurposed medications, and he had to keep the people who were getting AZT were dying so fast that he began sneaking them transfusions. So a lot of those people were getting blood full blood transfusions every day to keep him alive for the eight week period so he could declare victory.\" \n\n\"Then he got the permission to use the drug or, you know, he walked it through FDA like he does through a fixed FDA panel that's made up of his paid investigators. And then he mandated for everybody, not only who has AIDS, but people who are deemed by a PCR test to have HIV, many of whom would never get sick. And all of the virtually everybody who was on ATT died.\"\n\n\"Most of them died within a year. Almost all of them died within two years. He killed with AZT probably three hundred and thirty thousand people during the nineteen eighties and early nineteen nineties. The other thing he did, Del, which is part of this playbook that you're talking about, is he suppressed all of the drugs. There were local doctors who were treating AIDS patients in New York and San Francisco and Dallas, etcetera, they were finding a lot of drugs that worked for the AIDS symptoms very, very effectively.\"\n\nAerosol pentazine was one of those. It had tremendous efficacy. But the AIDS patients, most of them were impoverished because they couldn't work, were were unable to get it because the insurance companies would not give it to them because it wasn't approved by FDA. They were begging Tony Fauci to get FDA to approve, but he refused. He said, we don't have placebo controlled trials.\"\n\n\"And so that's what the film Dallas Buyers Club is about. It's people,  Matthew McConaughey and a lot of other people with the AIDS who discovered that AZT was killing everybody who was who was taking it, and they were and they were going to Mexico, to Canada, to Europe to get these drugs that actually worked, smuggling them back in The United States and distributing them to AIDS patients.\" \n\n\"And Michelle Wallace, who wrote that film, initially made Tony Fauci the antagonist in her script. He was the villain in the film. In the end, when they made the film, they took him out of it. He was the guy who was killing all these hate patients, denying them a drug that the local doctors had proven work.\" \n\nMy uncle, as I show in the book, Teddy Kennedy, was deeply involved in forcing Tony Fauci finally to approve this off purpose medication as the exact same thing he's done with ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine killing these drugs because they compete with the vaccines that he knows his buddies are gonna make money from.\"The media could not be played.Reload7:29 AM ¬∑ Feb 27, 2025¬∑139.5K Views1212.7K5K1KRead 121 replies",

It's like a seasonal flu. He had to block all those things in order to make way for his vaccines, and that's what he did. And that's why the Chinese had a population death rate. In other words, three people die from COVID per million population. Our population death rate was twenty two hundred per million.
